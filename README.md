# about-me
TL;DR:

Mitchell was born in Davenport, Iowa in 1998. He is an only child. His father worked for Alcoa at the time and his mother worked for an an architecture firm. Shortly after he turned four, his father's job moved to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania so the family moved with him. His mother gave up on finding work because of the many places that she had lived with her husband in the past. She became a stay at home mom for her son.

Mitchell attended Seneca Valley School District once he became old enough. He had an interest in Math and Science before the 5th grade. He wanted to know more about space and how the universe works. He fueled this hunger by watching shoes such as "How the Universe Works" and "Through the Wormhole with Morgan Freeman". Being engaged with these shows made him realize that he wanted to do these things for the rest of his life.

High school was a crazy time. Mitchell attended Seneca Valley Intermediate and Senior High School where he was a grade ahead in his math courses and was breezed through all of his classes until junior year. He was taking both AP Calculus AB and AP Statistics for math classes while the average student at the school took one class or the other in his or her senior year. Statistics was much harder than anticipated. The math was not difficult but the concepts were abstract. Calculus was the opposite. It was much simpler than expected. When he took the AP tests, he scored the opposite of what would be expected. He only got a 2 on the Calculus exam while attaining a 5 on the Statistics exam. Hard work leads to success.
